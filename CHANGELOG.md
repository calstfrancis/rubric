## 0.12 — GitHub sync, planner, simple mode, redo, HTML export

### Added

- **Simple mode** (on by default) — hides LaTeX export buttons, GitHub sync, CSV export, snippets, responsive reading, and the LaTeX preamble preference from new users. Toggle in **Preferences → View → Simple mode**. All features remain fully accessible when turned off; keyboard shortcuts continue to work regardless.
- **Redo** (Ctrl+Shift+Z) — redo button added to the header bar beside undo. Any new action clears the redo stack.
- **HTML export** (hamburger menu → Export) — generates a clean, print-ready HTML file and opens it in the default browser. Use File → Print in the browser to produce a PDF without LaTeX. Handles scripture blocks, bold/italic markup, and section headings.
- **Bulletin export → HTML in simple mode** — in simple mode, Export Bulletin bypasses LaTeX entirely and opens an HTML bulletin in the browser. Includes church name, service details, order of service (bulletin-visible elements only), active announcements, staff list, mission statement, and accessibility note. Expired announcements are filtered automatically.
- **GitHub repository sync** — set up a local git repository from **Preferences → GitHub** and push/pull to GitHub with one click (⟳ toolbar button or Ctrl+Shift+G). Features:
  - Guided setup: browse to a folder, click Set up — creates `liturgy/`, `tex/`, `pdf/`, `bulletins/` subfolders, a LaTeX-aware `.gitignore`, and runs `git init`
  - Remote URL field + Connect button to link a GitHub repository
  - Pull button in Preferences for downloading changes from another machine
  - Automatic commit message from the service title and date — no typing required
  - First-push upstream tracking handled automatically
  - Friendly error messages for auth failures and missing remotes
- **Repository-aware default save paths** — when a GitHub repository is configured, Save As defaults to `repo/liturgy/`, Export LaTeX to `repo/tex/`, Export Bulletin (advanced mode) to `repo/bulletins/`, and compiled PDFs move automatically to `repo/pdf/` (service order) or `repo/bulletins/` (bulletin).
- **Service Planner** (hamburger menu → Service Planner, Ctrl+Shift+L) — scans the `liturgy/` folder and lists all `.liturgy` files grouped into Upcoming and Past, sorted by date, showing element count. Click any row to open that service. If no repository is configured, prompts to choose a folder. Refresh button to rescan.
- **Scripture translation selector** (Preferences → Scripture) — choose between:
  - **WEB** (World English Bible) — public domain, works with no setup
  - **KJV** (King James Version) — public domain
  - **ASV** (American Standard Version) — public domain
  - **ESV** — free API key from api.esv.org; ministry and bulletin use explicitly permitted
  - The Bible Viewer title and attribution line update to match the selected translation.

### Fixed

- **Bulletin compile error (memoir class)** — in simple mode, bulletin export no longer attempts LaTeX compilation at all, bypassing the `memoir` class requirement that caused silent failures on minimal TeX Live installations.
- **Bulletin compile error reporting** — `result.stderr` was never checked; both stdout and stderr are now combined when looking for xelatex error lines.
- **Bulletin PDF compile threading violation** — GTK calls in error paths now go through `GLib.idle_add`.
- `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\s'` on launch — caused by `\sverse` in a non-raw docstring.
- Hymn title from Hymnary now correctly strips the book name prefix.
- Multi-line verse joining in `_passage_to_latex`.
- **Boilerplate text group in Bulletin prefs** — closure capture bug fixed.

  - **Digital / screen** — `extarticle`, full letter, colour hyperlinks
- **Per-element bulletin toggle** — 📋 button marks each element shown or hidden in the bulletin independently of the leader copy
- **Bulletin preferences tab** — church name, address, service time, website, email, phone, welcome line, accessibility note, mission statement, staff/contact list, announcements with optional expiry dates
- **Lectionary year tracker** — persistent Year A/B/C and season indicator in the header
- **Per-Proper hymn suggestions** (Propers 4–29)
